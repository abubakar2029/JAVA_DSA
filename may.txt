Here’s a few thoughts… (from a 63 year old man).   Set aside gender.   Practice being a good human.   Let go of the need to dominate.    Let go of the negative connotations of being a man.     
We are here for a short visit.   Practice harm free living.   Embrace love of life and all things living.    
Turn away from influencers, following any influencer/ guru  too close will create a copy at best.    
Develop a practice of turning off the outside noise to hear what comes from within.    
Discover what sparks for you.    Bring it to life and live passionately. 
Do not believe all of the nonsense that is being pushed at you from all directions.   
We all have the equal right to live in peace. 
It is up to each of us, (humans), to take responsibility for our actions and create a reality worth living.
